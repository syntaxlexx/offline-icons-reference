# Offline Icons Reference
Do you have times you wish to find an icon superfast? And works completely offline? A project you can always rely upon in your development machine when you are at your granny's house with no WI-FI? Or simply you hate looking for that icon online? 

Or even better, the online docs have terrible copy-paste functionality that is just missing...that something! That UI/UX!

Well, here it is! You have it now! Runs completely offline, uses [Vue](https://vuejs.org) so you can add your fonts later, and it's portable! Works anywhere!

### Why this project? What actually transpired...
Maze leo (Thursday 21 Nov, 2019) si nimeamka kusaka font flani, nikaboeka mbaya! Finding it online consumed bundles, copy-pasting was sh*t.... Imebidi niunde my own offline library 😅 ambayo itawork hadi kwa simu kama PWA(coming soon). Staki ujinga!

## Features
- Offline icons for the most popular icon libraries
- Added search (filtering) to all icon sets
- Powered by [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org) which is amazingly fast!
- Ability to copy either the icon's name, icon html, or icon HEX
- Future support for a PWA
