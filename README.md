# Offline Icons Reference
Do you have times you wish to find an icon superfast? And works completely offline? A project you can always rely upon in your development machine when you are at your granny's house with no wifi? Or simply you hate looking for that icon online? 

Or even better, the online docs have terrible copy-paste functionality that is just missing...that something! That UI/UX!

Well, here it is! You have it now! Runs completely offline, uses [Vue](https://vuejs.org) so you can add your fonts later, and it's portable! Works anywhere!

## Features
- Offline icons for the most popular icon libraries
- Added search (filtering) to all icon sets
- Powered by [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org) which is amazingly fast!
- Ability to copy either the icon's name, icon html, or icon HEX
- Future support for a PWA

## Crowdfunding
It's also possible to support the project on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/lexxyungcarter) or by buying products and merchandise at [Marketplace](https://marketplace.acelords.space).
